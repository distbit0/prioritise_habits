# Decision Log

## 2026-02-18
- Enforced a global notes-append throttle for `inbox-index.md`: append at most one new habit line every 3 hours, tracked via `.last_notes_append`.
- Stopped rewriting/removing existing note lines during append; now only appends genuinely new habit lines to avoid batch inserts.
- Added persistent queueing in `.pending_notes_habits` so all eligible habits are eventually appended one-by-one every 3 hours instead of dropping extras.

## 2026-04-10
- Replaced the notes append throttle/queue with a persisted daily trigger schedule. Each due habit trigger gets a random local time from 06:00 through 12:00, and notes are appended only after that trigger time passes.
- Added `dailyTriggerCount` for habits that need multiple note triggers per due day without changing the meaning of existing numeric `goal` habits.
- Generalized due habit outputs with `dueOutputs.writeToMd` and `dueOutputs.desktopNotification`, and renamed the daily schedule file to `.habit_trigger_schedule` because it now drives both notes and desktop notifications.

## 2026-06-12
- Added `dueOutputs.textToSpeech`, backed by ElevenLabs MP3 generation and a local `.tts_cache/` so repeated habit prompts do not spend API credits.
- Text-to-speech is a gating output: if a trigger has TTS enabled but the default audio sink is not Bluetooth, the trigger stays pending and is retried by a later cron run.
- Added a process lock for the every-minute cron job so long sequential audio playback cannot overlap with the next invocation.

## 2026-06-13
- Added habit-level `audioFile` support for custom MP3 playback through the existing `textToSpeech` delivery channel. Custom audio does not fall back to generated TTS if the file is missing; the trigger remains pending until the path is fixed.

## 2026-06-25
- Added phone audio coordination for TTS batches through the MacroDroid audio toggle trigger. The script pauses phone audio once, waits 10 seconds, plays the queued habit audio sequentially, then waits 10 seconds and sends `state=play` once after the batch attempt finishes.

## 2026-06-27
- Disabled `reply-to-unread-msg` by removing it from `active_habits.json` and clearing its generated entries from the current daily trigger schedule. Historical check-ins remain in `habits_store.json`.
- Changed the Bitwarden/KeePass, Call Noni, people outreach, and accepted tweet habits to append notes only by leaving `writeToMd` enabled and disabling `textToSpeech`.
