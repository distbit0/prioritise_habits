# Habit Prioritization Script (Local JSON Store)

This script prioritizes your due habits from a local JSON file. It does not call TickTick.

## What it does

- Reads active habits, archived habits, and check-in history from local JSON files.
- Finds habits due today from each habit's `repeatRule`.
- Calculates completion rate over `lookBackDays`.
- Reorders due habits so lower completion rates are prioritized first.
- Updates habit names with numeric prefixes (for ordered display).
- Records today's completion in the local `checkins` store.
- Samples each due habit trigger time between 06:00 and 12:00 local time.
- Writes ready habit names to enabled due outputs once their sampled trigger time has passed.
- Speaks ready habit names from cached ElevenLabs MP3s, or plays a configured habit MP3 file, when the default audio output is Bluetooth.

## Configuration

Edit [`config.json`](config.json):

```json
{
  "lookBackDays": 21,
  "habitsStoreFile": "./habits_store.json",
  "activeHabitsFile": "./active_habits.json",
  "textToSpeech": {
    "provider": "elevenlabs",
    "voiceId": "JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
    "modelId": "eleven_multilingual_v2",
    "outputFormat": "mp3_44100_128",
    "cacheDir": "./.tts_cache"
  }
}
```

- `lookBackDays`: number of days used when calculating completion rate.
- `habitsStoreFile`: path to the archived habit and check-in store.
- `activeHabitsFile`: path to the editable non-archived habits file.
- `textToSpeech`: ElevenLabs voice/model/output settings and MP3 cache directory.

Relative paths are resolved from the repo root.
Set `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` in `.env`. The key is not logged or committed.

## Active Habit Format

Active/non-archived habits live in [`active_habits.json`](active_habits.json). The
file is a JSON list, and each object keeps the full habit record so edits do not
discard TickTick-derived metadata:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "habit-1",
    "name": "Read",
    "repeatRule": "RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1",
    "reminders": ["06:00"],
    "targetStartDate": "2025-01-01",
    "goal": 1,
    "dailyTriggerCount": 1,
    "dueOutputs": {
      "writeToMd": true,
      "desktopNotification": false,
      "textToSpeech": true
    },
    "audioFile": "audio/read.mp3",
    "archivedTime": null,
    "sortOrder": 1
  }
]
```

The most commonly edited fields are ordered near the top. Unknown fields are
preserved when the app saves the file.

## Habit Store Format

Archived habits and completion history live in [`habits_store.json`](habits_store.json):

```json
{
  "habits": [
    {
      "id": "habit-2",
      "name": "Archived habit",
      "archivedTime": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000+0000"
    }
  ],
  "checkins": {
    "habit-1": [
      {
        "id": "habit-1-20260224",
        "habitId": "habit-1",
        "checkinStamp": 20260224,
        "goal": 1,
        "value": 1,
        "status": 2,
        "checkinTime": "2026-02-24T12:00:00.000+0000",
        "opTime": "2026-02-24T12:00:00.000+0000"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `active_habits.json` must contain only habits where `archivedTime` is missing or null.
- `habits_store.json` `habits` must contain only archived habits.
- Every habit object must include at least `id` and `name`.
- `checkins` must be an object keyed by habit id.
- Habits with `archivedTime` are treated as inactive.
- `dailyTriggerCount` is optional and defaults to `1`. Use `2` for a habit that should trigger twice on each due day.
- `dueOutputs` is optional and defaults to `writeToMd` and `textToSpeech` enabled.
- Set `writeToMd`, `desktopNotification`, and `textToSpeech` independently.
- `audioFile` is optional. When present with `textToSpeech` enabled, it must point to an `.mp3` file and is played instead of calling ElevenLabs. Relative paths are resolved from the repo root.

## Trigger Scheduling

Each run creates or reuses a daily trigger schedule at `.habit_trigger_schedule`.
For each due habit trigger, the script samples a local time from 06:00 through 12:00.
Only triggers whose sampled time has passed are written to their enabled outputs.
Desktop notifications are created with `notify-send` using critical urgency and no expiry.
Text-to-speech uses cached ElevenLabs MP3 files and plays them sequentially with `ffplay`, adding a short silent lead-in so Bluetooth outputs do not clip the first word.
Habits can set `audioFile` to play a custom MP3 through the same gated audio channel instead of generating speech.
Audio only runs when `wpctl inspect @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@` shows a Bluetooth sink.
If the default output is not Bluetooth, the trigger is left pending for a later run.

Run the script repeatedly during that window, for example from cron or another scheduler, if you want habits to appear throughout the morning instead of all at once.

## Usage

```bash
uv run --env-file .env python src/main.py
```

Run in test mode:
